Docker's documentation provides everything a developer needs to containerize applications. You can start by installing Docker Desktop for your specific operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux). The "Get started" guide covers the fundamental concepts of containerization, while the "Guides" section offers practical steps for optimizing development workflows. To define your application's environment, you'll use a `Dockerfile` with Docker Build, and for managing multi-container applications, you can use Docker Compose. The documentation also includes extensive reference materials for the CLI and APIs, as well as information on sharing and finding images on Docker Hub.
