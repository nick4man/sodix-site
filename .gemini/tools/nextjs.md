The Next.js documentation is designed to help you build full-stack web applications using React. For new projects, you should begin with the "Getting Started" section, which walks you through creating an application and learning core features. It's important to understand the two routing systems available: the newer, recommended App Router and the original Pages Router. The documentation assumes you are already familiar with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. You can find detailed technical information in the API Reference and specific use-case tutorials in the Guides section.
